<p>The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it&rsquo;s a powerful tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren&rsquo;t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including &ldquo;high-performance computing&rdquo; supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.</p>
