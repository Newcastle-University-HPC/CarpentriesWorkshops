Title,Base Workshop,Default Description,,,,
Unix Shell,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-UnixShell/,"The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because it's a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows. Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.",,,,
Version Control with Git,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-Git/,"Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.",,,,
Programming with Python,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-PyProg/,This lesson serves as an introduction to Python 3 for people with little or no previous programming experience.,,,,
HPC Carpentry,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/38e65c01-61c6-43/,This two-day course covers High Performance Computing (HPC) and how to access remote advanced computing facilities via the command line. The first day will introduce how to use the shell in an HPC context. The second day will cover how to use HPC systems effectively. Please note that the first day is optional in case you’re already familiar with the shell.,,,,
HPC Day 1 of 2: The Unix Shell,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-UnixShell/,"Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. It is a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows. This workshop will introduce you to this powerful tool  and get you set up with access to an HPC for the following day's HPC Carpentry workshop.",,,,
HPC Day 2 of 2: ,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-HPC-Carpentry/,This  course covers High Performance Computing (HPC) and how to access remote advanced computing facilities via the command line.  It is expected that most participants will attend the Unix Shell Workshop on the preceding day for an introduction to using the shell in an HPC context and assisted setup of access to an HPC system. This second day will cover how to use HPC systems effectively.,,,,
Programming with R,https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/sage/RSE-Rprog/,This lesson serves as an introduction to R for people with little or no previous programming experience.,,,,
