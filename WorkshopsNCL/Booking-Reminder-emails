Please complete the pre-workshop survey. This helps us tailor the workshop pace and, along with a post-workshop survey, allows us to evaluate its effectiveness. 

Online Environment: The workshop will be delivered in an online environment. If you wish to install specific tools on your personal laptop, you are welcome to do so. However, please note that our assistance with software installation is limited. We cannot install software on institutional laptops without administrative rights. 

Breaks and Refreshments: 

There will be two coffee breaks and a lunch break during the day. Tea and coffee will be provided but please bring your own cup if you can. 
The times of these breaks can be found on the workshop website at:

Attendance Confirmation:
